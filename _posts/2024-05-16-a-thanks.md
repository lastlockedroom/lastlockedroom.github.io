It's been a while since my last post. Truth be told, I'm in somewhat of a slump in a lot of ways. Working my way through it.

I just wanted to write this short entry to give thanks to my Chinese readers -- an audience I genuinely didn't think my original works would ever reach.

Firstly, I want to thank **Fang's Mystery Blog** for [writing a post on *Gospel of V*](https://lockedroom.net/blog/?p=6550). Obviously, I'm limited to using Google Translate to understand the overall sentiment, so I won't presume it to be positive or negative -- I'm just happy that they took the time to write an entry on it! (That said, they do seem to have given it five stars on [this page](https://book.douban.com/subject/36843360/), so I think it leans to positive! And again -- a huge thanks for that!)

Speaking of *Gospel*, the user **月神sin** has translated [its opening chapter](https://www.douban.com/note/861636015/?_i=5866362K5Kp7go,5866469K5Kp7go)! I'm not sure if they translated more (I can't browse deeper into the site without registering onto the site), but I'm super happy about seeing even this much!

And on the subject of translations, both the [Black Pyramid Incident](https://www.douban.com/note/861145588/?_i=5864868K5Kp7go,5865251K5Kp7go) and [Pandora's Box](https://www.douban.com/note/861297981/?_i=5865117K5Kp7go) have been translated by the user **流风四月**! 

I don't really know how anyone came across this stuff, but as I keep saying -- this makes me really happy! Thank you all -- both the translators and the people who read them!

As a short general sort of update -- if you happen to still be waiting for *Gospel of V* to come out somewhere other than Amazon, my apologies; due to my own negligence to sign it out of the Kindle Direct program, I believe I'll need another few months before I can put it up elsewhere.

But until then -- if you really wanna read it -- feel free to reach out to me either via any of the socials listed on the side and I'm sure we can work something out (wink-wink-nudge-nudge).
