A madman claims to create a portal between a small American town and Paris -- using the Eiffel Tower. 

To achieve this, he buys the Eiffel Tower and adorns its top with an upside-down black pyramid. He then builds a perfect replica of the construction in the US.

By entering the pyramid in one tower, you will exit the pyramid in the other.

A paranormal investigator is called to see if the claim is true.

Below is an afterword. Although it has no direct spoilers, I suggest reading this only after finishing the story.

I conceived *The Black Pyramid Incident* in a fairly short amount of time. The main motivation was to create something with a solution so outrageous it would make my friend [Zep](https://twitter.com/TheNekogamiCat) raise an eyebrow. I don't know how successful I was in the goal -- Zep generally has a pretty high tolerance for the ridiculous in general -- but the rest of my beta-readers seemed to agree it went beyond their own levels of expectation.

The main idea came from a misunderstanding on my part. Years ago, I had read about Soji Shimada's *The Crystal Pyramid* in [this blog post](https://ho-lingnojikenbo.blogspot.com/2013/09/the-fourth-side-of-triangle.html). For some reason, thinking about it later, I was convinced that the crime of that book featured a murder in a glass pyramid someone had built on top of the Eiffel Tower.

This was, obviously, not the case.

But hey -- the image of a pyramid on the Eiffel Tower is kind of cool, isn't it?

The main challenge was figuring out what the point of such a construction would've been. 

One of the ideas I had was that the pyramid was upside-down because it was meant to serve as an elaborate signal reflector. The idea was that a murderer who lives on an isolated station on the Moon projected his form to a murder scene by bouncing his signal off several disconnected satellites and the pyramid.

Somehow, it didn't feel impressive enough, though.

The solution for the actual idea -- the teleportation between two sides of the world -- went through several iterations, and some of them made their way into the story as false solutions.

As ridiculous as it might've turned out in the end, I hope you like the story!
