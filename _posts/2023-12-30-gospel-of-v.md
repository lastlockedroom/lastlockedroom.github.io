**Virgil Hesse has disappeared. All that remains of him is a manuscript for a story: a locked room murder mystery.**

The Cosmigrove family reunites for the first time in years. The family's patriarch, the infamous Joseph Cosmigrove, is dying. He'd dedicated his life to his art -- and his death will prove to be nothing short of artistic.

One morning, the family awakens to find that someone has dug a hole in their garden. At its bottom lies a skeleton.

A prologue to a series of bizarre murders that will soon fall upon the family. The skeleton begins to move through the house, as if through walls, escaping from and into locked rooms.

**--That is the story.**

**But the story, as the editors reading it will find, is more than just mere fiction. Soon enough, it bleeds into the real world in the most horrifying of ways.**

First Amazon release! It probably should've happened sooner, but better late than never.

*Gospel* was written during my two-month stay in the America, at the height of the most recent mystery novel binge. It's a story alternating between a fictional manuscript and the discussion of the two editors trying to untangle it. I'm surprised I hadn't really done something like this earlier (at least, in non-fanwork context). 

Personally, I think it turned out very well! I think the focus on mystery and fast pace will appeal to most readers (now that I'm publicly on Amazon and actually charging money for this, I do need to think a *little* about general appeal, I suppose... but only a little). It's still a work primarily intended for people who like mystery fiction to begin with, though, since there's discussion on tropes and logical extremes in both sides of the narrative.

As always, a huge thanks to selkie for the cover art. And thanks to all the beta-readers!

As I talked about before, I'll probably be releasing *Odyssey to the Castle of Vampires* and a collection of some of my previously-published stories next. The former to have a paperback edition and the latter because I've gotten a bit tired of publishing on Medium. In the long run, there's a good chance most if not all my stuff will find its way to Amazon at some point.

I'd mentioned that I would also be releasing *Gospel* on *itch*, where I'd previously released my novels. This has slightly changed in the short term -- I've enrolled the Kindle version of *Gospel* in Amazon's KDP Select program, meaning that Amazon gets exclusivity for the ebook version of the book for the next 90 days. The flip-side of that is that, if you're on Kindle Unlimited, you should be able to read the book for free!

Once again, a huge thanks to everyone who helped out -- and many thanks to anyone who ends up reading it!
