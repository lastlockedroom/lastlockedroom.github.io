The original hand-written draft of Christianna Brand's iconic *Death of Jezebel* is found. 

Its discoverer, the illusive Mr. Black, is eager to auction it off. He invites three potential buyers to his castle, along with a detective to help him guard the manuscript. The buyers are given only one chance to make their bid -- privately, without knowing the bids of the other buyers. Whoever makes the highest one between the three, wins.

It's a game.

One that goes terribly wrong. After announcing the winner of the auction, Mr. Black vanishes. The manuscript, kept locked in a tower and under constant watch, bursts into flames. The suspect, a black knight, is seen fleeing from the scene... flying from the tower window, into the sky.

*Note: Reading 'Death of Jezebel' is not required, but might make the reading more enjoyable. A one-paragraph 'pitch' of the story is given, but there should be no actual spoilers.*

Below is an afterword. Although it has no direct spoilers, I suggest reading this only after finishing the story.

I've had the idea for a story in which a book is 'murdered' for a while now. For some reason, I'd also decided early on to make that book be Brand's *Death of Jezebel*. I don't really know why -- it's not like I dislike the book (even if I definitely don't like it as much as everyone else might). Originally, I think the intention was to have the book's 'murder' vaguely resemble the murder in the actual book. Kind of like a *mitate* murder, in which the work being emulated was also the work that gets 'killed'.

It didn't get much further than that, though. At the time, I didn't have a particular trick in mind, and a pastiche for the sake of making a pastiche felt pretty uninspired.

It wasn't until I read [this post](https://rudetection.wordpress.com/2023/11/09/definition-of-a-deductive-story/) that the idea re-emerged, and I decided to have some fun. While I'm generally not a fan of categorizations in art, I think the definition isn't unreasonable... but it *did* feel exploitable. 

Hence, this story was born. Obviously, no ill will towards the blog's author or anything. There is no real joke on their expense -- the blog post is more of a spring board for the story than anything.

That said, some of the discussion around this post on the [Honkaku Discord](https://discord.gg/z3HMSmf8qd) did make me realize there was an important aspect in which I view mystery fiction differently from... probably most people? It's definitely something I'll probably discuss separately.

Anyhow, I hope you like(d) the story!
