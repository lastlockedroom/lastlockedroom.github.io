I have a long and extensive history of writing fanfiction tied to mystery-related media. Although the list below is not extensive (somewhat intentionally), it should give a good sample size of the kind of work I'm known for within the original works' respective communities.

# Umineko

[Umineko no Naku Koro Ni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umineko_When_They_Cry) is probably the work that has influenced me the most as a writer. It was the first that really introduced me to the *concept* of impossible crimes and locked room mysteries and showed me that limits of mystery fiction were far from set in stone. For all its faults -- and it does have them -- it is a good stepping stone for anyone wanting to build toward a new generation of mystery writers.

Below are some of the Umineko-related works I've made over the years.

All of these works presume that the reader has **read through all of Umineko**.

## Games

Below are interactive visual novels I've made taking place (directly or tangentially) within the Umineko universe.

# Ace Attorney

My initial years on the internet were largely devoted to the [Ace Attorney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Attorney) community. I've written a large number of fan-cases over the years. Most of them, while varying in quality, represent a period of my life that has given me many friends and taught me a lot about what goes into constructing stories.

Most of the stories here **assume that the reader has at least played the games up to, and including, Apollo Justice**.
