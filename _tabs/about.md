Welcome to The Last Locked Room!

I'm H. M. Faust (also known as **DWaM**), a mystery writer specializing in coming up with stories featuring *impossible crimes*. Whether it's a murder happening in a room that was locked from the inside, or an impossible disappearance, or someone being killed in an open field with no trace of the culprit's footprints, or just plain bizarre phenomena -- I've done it all.

My goal is to push the limits of the genre by playing with its tropes and utilize unbelievable tricks that no "serious" authors would think to do.

This is a site I've made for the purpose of cataloging all my works and maintaining an intermittent blog.

A complete list of my original works can be found [here](/original-fiction).

Over the years, I've also produced a large amount of fanworks, which can be found [here](/fanworks).
