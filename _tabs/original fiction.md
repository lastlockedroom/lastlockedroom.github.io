Below is a complete list of all the original works I've completed to date.

# Mystery Fiction

I aim to make my mysteries bizarre, unique and -- almost without fail -- have them feature an impossible crime of some kind. From the classic locked room mystery to world-ending phenomena, there should be something for everyone.

The stories *are* generally geared towards people already familiar with some of the tropes of the genre, but extensive knowledge is not required.

## Novels & Novellas

My novels and novellas. Size-wise, most of them are between 40-60K words, making them about a day's read. Almost all feature some kind of impossible crime, generally a locked room murder.
